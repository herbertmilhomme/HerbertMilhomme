<p>Thank you for visiting. Your privacy is important to me. To help protect your privacy, I provide this notice explaining my online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected on my online and mobile websites, services, and applications (&ldquo;Site&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sites&rdquo;), as of the effective date indicated above. It applies to information I collect before, on and after the effective date. <!--This policy should be read in conjunction with my <a class="reference external" href="/public/terms">Terms of Service.</a>--></p>
<p><em>Herbert Milhomme</em> takes seriously the privacy of those 
that visit the web site. In this document, <!--the term--> &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;my&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;me&rdquo; <!--shall refer--> refers to myself, <!--the entity--> <em>Herbert Milhomme</em>, and &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to you, the user or customer to whom this policy applies. 
I have established this Privacy Policy to communicate what 
information I collect and how that information is used and safeguarded.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights. 
By accessing or using this website <em>herbertmilhomme.com</em>, you acknowledge and expressly consent to my collection, use, disclosure, retention of your personal information, and also the 
terms and conditions as described or expressed herein, in this notice. I reserve the right to change 
this policy at my sole discretion and without notice.</p>
<h2>What information is collected, and why?</h2>
<p>When a user visits my website, I collect information about the 
visit that does not identify the user personally. I track information 
such as the domain from which the user is visiting and the user's 
browser type. I also collect specific information regarding the user's 
session on my website. This includes items such as the date and time of
 the visit and the pages viewed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask a user to voluntarily provide personally 
identifiable information (PII). This information generally includes, but
 is not limited to, name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone 
number. I request this information when the user requests one of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To register to attend an on-line seminar or demonstration</li>
    <li>To receive specific information from us such as a whitepaper or code sample</li>
    <li>To sign up for a mailing list</li>
    <li>To correspond with us</li>
    <li>Or any other such activity that I deem necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Herbert Milhomme</em> does not collect any personally identifiable 
financial or health-related information. I do not intentionally collect
 information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<h2>How is the information used?</h2>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is collected to 
allow us to analyze how my website is used and to improve the content 
and service the website provides.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is collected for analysis to 
improve the content of the website and the services I provide the user.</p>
<p><em>Herbert Milhomme</em> owns the collected information and will not sell, 
trade, or rent the information to others. I may use the information to 
continue contact with the user. This may include contact such as 
follow-up calls, e-mail correspondence, or mail correspondence to 
follow-up on the contact or to provide marketing information about 
promotions, new services, or important website changes. <em>Herbert Milhomme</em>
 may share this information with its business partners for the specific 
purpose of a promotion or service offering.</p>
<h2>Are &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; used on the website?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are small pieces of information that are placed on a web 
user's hard drive. I may use cookies to provide you with better 
service. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to 
your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make 
the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences for a 
particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many 
major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers.
 Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although
 they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to 
accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse 
cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of the 
functionality of the <em>Herbert Milhomme</em> site if you do so.</p>
<h2>How is personally identifiable information safeguarded?</h2>
<p><em>Herbert Milhomme</em> utilizes industry standard methods and mechanisms 
such as firewalls, intrusion monitoring, and passwords to protect 
electronic information. Multiple physical security methods such as 
locking devices and 24 hour premise monitoring are also employed. 
Finally, access to PII is limited to a small number of personnel and on a
 need-to-know basis.</p>
	<h2>Financial information</h2>
<p>If you elect to pay for tutoring lessons with a credit card, I will collect your name, credit card number, expiration date, and address information associated with the account. All financial information is collected and encrypted in my System in full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.</p>
	<h2>Online tracking</h2>
<p>Some browsers allow you to indicate that you would not like your online activities tracked, using &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; indicators (&ldquo;DNT Indicators&rdquo;), however, I am not obligated to respond to these indicators. Presently, I am not set up to respond to DNT Indicators. This means that while the Site may track certain latent information about your online activities, the collected information will be used to improve your use of my Site and in ways consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2>Notification regarding updates</h2>
<p><em>Herbert Milhomme</em> reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy, from time to time, due to modifications to the Site&rsquo;s features and functionality. I will post any changes here and indicate the new effective date of the Privacy Policy at the top of the document. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy for any updates while you are an active User of the Site.</p>
<p><!--From time to time, I may update this Privacy Policy. -->I may notify you about material changes in the way I treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on my Sites or by sending you an email message. I remind you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know my current privacy practices.</p>

If you are using the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where my servers are located and my databases are operated.
