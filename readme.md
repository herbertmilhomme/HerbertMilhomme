# Project Name

Herbert Milhomme: My Web Portfolio

## Status

I'll take a step back from adding new functions and features, to sort out and manage my dysfunctional website, so that i may offer a more appropriate and encouraging display of my skills.

## Description

In my attempts to "Show my work" these are the main core goals i aim to build and grow towards. With the unwritten rule ("programming is 20% coding and 80% maintenance"). I've decided to include a change-log to further address and acknowledge my abilities, growth, and progress throughout my portfolio. To present the "show your work" concept even more, I'm including my entire Web directory (minus sensitive info, of course), starting with current beginning/entry state as "Alpha:0.0.0". I'll notate and resolve bugs as they are reported, and include an api report page linked from my site to github. Using github as my central workspace and mirroring results across platforms.

## Contributing

Since this is a portfolio to represent my skills and abilities, i prefer contributions to be kept to a minimum.

If you like you may contribute by submitting bug reports, thru the issue's tab, or contacting me thru any of my active channels.

I don't mind critiques or corrections to any of the codes or documents you've acquired thru my github. A lot of it were influenced by other sources i've found on the web, and learned from non-formal practices.
