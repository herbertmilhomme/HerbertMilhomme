        <h3>1. Ownership of Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>A. Except for the Background Technology as defined in Exhibit A (License Agreement), Client shall own all right, title and interest in and to any and all Deliverables (as defined in the Website Proposal), project descriptions and specifications (including any copyrights therein) which may be included in Deliverables.  Vendor and Client expressly agree that, other than the Background Technology, the work performed by Vendor hereunder shall be work made for hire to the maximum extended permitted by the United States Copyright Act, and that Client shall be the exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Deliverables hereunder, including any and all ideas, inventions and works of authorship (including developments, innovations and improvements to existing Client products or confidential information) conceived or made by Vendor alone or with others in the course of Vendor's engagement hereunder, together with any and all copyrights, trade secret rights, patents and other proprietary rights therein, whether now known or hereafter to become known, for the respective maximum terms of protection available throughout the world (the &ldquo;Client Intellectual Property&rdquo;).  In the event that all the foregoing right, title and interest do not vest automatically in Client, Vendor hereby irrevocably transfers, sells and assigns to Client, its successors and assigns, all such right, title and interest (including any and all copyrights, trade secret rights, patents and other proprietary rights therein).

In connection therewith, Client grants to Vendor a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicenseable license to use Client&rsquo;s Marks for the purposes contemplated by this Section.  All uses of the Marks shall be in accordance with the Mark guidelines provided by Client from time to time.  Nothing contained herein shall give Vendor any interest in Client&rsquo;s Marks.  Vendor shall not take any action that would impair the value of, or goodwill associated with, Client&rsquo;s Marks and, as between the parties, all uses of Client&rsquo;s Marks shall inure to the benefit of Client.</p>
        <h3>2. Confidential Information</h3>

        <h3>7. Relation of Parties</h3>
        <p>The performance by Vendor of its duties and obligations under this Agreement will be that of an independent contractor, and nothing herein will create or imply an agency relationship between Vendor and Client, nor will this Agreement be deemed to constitute a joint venture or partnership between the parties.</p>

The terms "former employee" and "former subcontractor" will include only those employees or subcontractors of either party who were employed or utilized by that party on the Effective Date of this Agreement.  Both parties agree that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the other party from employing general recruiting strategies, such as placement of advertisements, posting of positions on either party&rsquo;s web sites and other similar methods.</p>

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, Client shall, within 30 days of the date of termination, pay Vendor for all work performed up to the date of termination, based either on the quoted price per deliverable in the Website Proposal or, if no such definition was made, based on Vendor's standard hourly rate of $150, plus reimbursement for any project expenses. If monies paid by Client to Vendor under the Website Proposal exceed the amount due to Vendor under this Agreement, Vendor shall refund the difference to Client within 30 days of the date of termination.</p>
        <h3>10. Failure to Pay</h3>
        <p>If Client fails to pay any invoice within 60 days of due date, Vendor shall have the right to withhold further work.

        <h3>11. Non­Assignment; Successors; Third Party Beneficiaries</h3>

Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any Court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <h3>13. Severability</h3>
        <p>If any term of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or contrary to law, it will be modified to the least extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <h3>14. Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>If either party is prevented from complying, either totally or in part, with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, computer virus, war, accident, or other acts of God, then upon written notice to the other party, the requirements of this Agreement, or the affected provisions hereof to the extent affected, shall be suspended during the period of such disability. During such period, the party not prevented from complying may seek to have its needs (which would otherwise be met hereunder) met by the other without liability hereunder. The party prevented from complying shall make all reasonable efforts to remove such disability within ten (10) days of giving such notice and the party not prevented from complying pursuant to this Section may terminate this Agreement, without liability, upon expiration of such ten (10) day period.
